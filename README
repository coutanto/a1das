Set of utility functions to process FEBUS Optics A1 DAS data.
These codes are developped by DAS data end-users, not by FEBUS Optics.
FEBUS Optics has no responsability in the development nor in the distribution of these codes.

These codes come as python sources or binary modules

A html documentation is available into "documentation" directory

This package uses Febus format files (RAW, Strain, Strain rate) and a reducted file format both in a unified way.
The reducted format is not intented for data distribution but for convenient and fast IO. It uses HDF5 container
with a header metadata part and binary data.

The set of functions is divided into:
====================================

packages in the a1das directory:
-------------------------------

CORE: IO functions to open, read, write and various utilities (set origin time, convert to obspy stream, etc)
      usage:
      >> import a1das

REDUCTION: 
 - functions to reduce data (ie remove redundancy, decimate in space and/or time, select distance/time ranges, transpose space versus time)
 - function to convert raw to strain[rate]
      >> help(a1das.reduction)

XCOR: functions to compute cross-correlation optimized with openMP and MKL
      >> help(a1das.xcorr)

VSERVER: functions to emulate the DAS interrogator real time data stream. This allows to process files and play movies on the results
      >> help(a1das.vserver)

functions in other directories:
------------------------------

test: functions to test and show some examples

example: more sophisticated examples
